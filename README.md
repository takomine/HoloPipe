# HoloPipe

This is my personal backup of my [PipePipe](https://codeberg.org/NullPointerException/PipePipe) (a fork of [Newpipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe)) subscriptions. It includes the Youtube channels of all Hololive members (JP, EN, ID) and known clippers.


## Installation

Open the Subscriptions tab. Click `Previous export` under the `Import from`. Select the json file.
